# Credit_Card
This project is my very first project as a data analyst intern at Edulyt India.
For this project,I was provided with 3 tables where first table contained the data of 100 Customers along with their informations like Age, Company, Credit Card Product, Credit Limit, Segment and City.
During the course of this project,I have performed the tasks like Analyzing customers, their segments, spend and repayment amount and using pivoting concept to calculate various required values.
We  have to start with performing sanity checks  which includes age manipulation and calculating profits by Credit and Intrest.
After this,Insights were obtained by calculating profits on the basis of credit and intrest rates by merging several tables.
